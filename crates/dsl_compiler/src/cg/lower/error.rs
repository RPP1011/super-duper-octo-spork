//! Unified typed-error surface for every CG lowering pass.
//!
//! Phase 2 of the Compute-Graph IR pipeline (see
//! `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-29-dsl-compute-graph-ir.md`) splits
//! AST → CG lowering across one task per construct (expression, mask,
//! view, physics, scoring, spatial, plumbing, driver). Each task can
//! contribute new defect variants without inventing a sibling enum:
//! every pass returns [`LoweringError`].
//!
//! # Naming convention
//!
//! Variants that name a defect specific to one construct are prefixed
//! with the construct name to keep the enum readable as it grows:
//!
//! - `Mask*` for mask-lowering defects (`MaskPredicateNotBool`,
//!   `UnsupportedMaskFromClause`, `UnsupportedMaskHeadShape`, …).
//! - Future tasks follow the same shape — `View*`, `Scoring*`,
//!   `Physics*`, `Spatial*` — so a Task 2.4 author adding
//!   `ViewFoldHandlerNotBool` doesn't have to disambiguate against a
//!   bare `HandlerNotBool` shared with mask predicates.
//!
//! Variants that name a defect shared across passes (e.g.,
//! [`LoweringError::BuilderRejected`], [`LoweringError::TypeCheckFailure`])
//! stay unprefixed.
//!
//! # Why one enum
//!
//! Phase 2's tasks compound — the view pass calls into the expression
//! pass, the scoring pass into the view pass, and so on. A wrapper-per-pass
//! design (`MaskLoweringError::Predicate(LoweringError)`) builds linearly
//! deeper match nests as the call graph stacks up. A single enum keeps
//! `?`-propagation flat and `Display` chains readable.
